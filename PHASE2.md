# PHASE 2: Enhancing ML Operations with Containerization & Monitoring

## Overview
Phase 2 focuses on scaling and operationalizing SE 489 MLOps Project by implementing containerization, advanced monitoring, profiling, experiment tracking, and comprehensive logging. This phase ensures your model can be reliably deployed, monitored in production, and continuously improved through systematic experimentation.

---

- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Define and document required environment variables
- [ ] **Build Instructions**: Document how to build Docker image with examples
- [ ] **Run Instructions**: Document how to run container with proper volume/network config
- [ ] **Container Testing**: Test container locally to ensure consistency with host environment
- [ ] **Docker Compose (Optional)**: Create docker-compose.yml for multi-service setups
- [ ] **Environment Consistency**: Verify that containerized training produces identical results to local training

---

## 2. Monitoring & Debugging

- [ ] **Model Assertion Checks**: Add assertions to catch data/model anomalies early
- [ ] **Training Validation**: Implement sanity checks (NaN detection, shape validation, etc.)

---

## 3. Profiling & Optimization

- [ ] **CPU Profiling**: Use cProfile to profile training and inference
- [ ] **Memory Profiling**: Profile memory usage with memory_profiler or similar
- [ ] **GPU Profiling (if applicable)**: Use PyTorch Profiler or similar for GPU workloads
- [ ] **Profiling Results**: Document baseline profiling results and bottlenecks identified
- [ ] **Optimization 1**: Implement and measure optimization (e.g., vectorization, caching)
- [ ] **Optimization 2**: Implement and measure additional optimization
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarks**: Document before/after performance metrics
- [ ] **Optimization Documentation**: Explain each optimization and its impact

---

## 4. Experiment Management & Tracking

- [ ] **MLflow Setup**: Initialize MLflow tracking server and client configuration
  - OR **Weights & Biases Setup**: Initialize W&B project and team workspace
- [ ] **Metric Logging**: Log training/validation metrics for each experiment
- [ ] **Parameter Logging**: Log all hyperparameters and configuration values
- [ ] **Model Artifact Logging**: Save model checkpoints and artifacts to tracking system
- [ ] **Experiment Comparison**: Create comparison of at least 3 different experiments
- [ ] **Visualization**: Generate performance comparison charts/plots
- [ ] **Best Model Selection**: Document criteria and process for selecting best model from experiments
- [ ] **Experiment Documentation**: Create table summarizing all experiments with results

---

## 5. Application & Experiment Logging

- [ ] **Logger Setup**: Configure Python logger with appropriate handlers and formatters
  - OR **Rich Library Setup**: Use rich for enhanced console output and logging
- [ ] **Log Levels**: Implement and use DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR appropriately
- [ ] **Log Messages**: Add informative log messages at key points in code
- [ ] **Training Log Example**: Document and include sample training log output
- [ ] **Inference Log Example**: Document and include sample inference log output
- [ ] **Error Logging**: Implement comprehensive error logging with context
- [ ] **Performance Logging**: Log timing information for performance analysis
- [ ] **Log Rotation**: Configure log rotation to prevent disk space issues

---

## 6. Configuration Management

- [ ] **Hydra Setup**: Install and configure Hydra for config management
- [ ] **Config Files**: Create YAML config files for train/eval/inference configurations
- [ ] **Config Structure**: Organize configs with appropriate hierarchy (base, model, data, etc.)
- [ ] **Config Example 1**: Create and document sample training config
- [ ] **Config Example 2**: Create and document alternative config (different hyperparameters)
- [ ] **Config Validation**: Implement config validation and schema checking
- [ ] **Override Documentation**: Document how to override config values from command line
- [ ] **Config Version Control**: Version all configs alongside code

---

## 7. Documentation & Repository Updates
