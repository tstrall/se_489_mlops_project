# PHASE 3: Continuous Machine Learning (CML) & Deployment

## Overview
Phase 3 implements continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and productionizes SE 489 MLOps Project on cloud infrastructure. This phase covers automated testing, containerized workflows, CML integration, and multi-platform deployment options including GCP, Cloud Run, and serverless functions.
