# PHASE 1: Project Design & Model Development

## Overview
Phase 1 establishes the foundation for your MLOps project. This phase covers project planning, initial code organization, team collaboration setup, data handling, baseline model development, and comprehensive documentation. By the end of this phase, you should have a well-organized repository with a trained baseline model and clear documentation for future team members.

---

## 1. Project Proposal

- [ ] **Scope & Objectives**: Define the problem statement, goals, and success metrics for SE 489 MLOps Project
- [ ] **Detailed Description**: Write a 300+ word project description covering the business context, technical approach, and expected outcomes
- [ ] **Dataset Selection**: Choose appropriate dataset(s) and document the selection justification
- [ ] **Dataset Description**: Document dataset characteristics (size, features, format, sources)
- [ ] **Model Considerations**: Identify initial model architectures and algorithms suitable for your problem
- [ ] **Open-Source Tools**: Document and justify the selection of open-source tools and libraries for the project

---

## 2. Code Organization & Setup

- [ ] **GitHub Repository**: Create repository with cookiecutter MLOps structure
- [ ] **Environment Setup**: Configure Python virtual environment (venv or conda)
- [ ] **Dependency Management**: Create and maintain requirements.txt or pyproject.toml
- [ ] **Project Structure**: Organize code with clear separation of concerns (src/, tests/, data/, etc.)
- [ ] **Version Pinning**: Pin all critical dependencies to specific versions
- [ ] **Installation Documentation**: Document how to set up the development environment

---

## 3. Version Control & Collaboration

- [ ] **Regular Commits**: Establish commit discipline with descriptive, atomic commits
- [ ] **Branching Strategy**: Implement feature branching (e.g., git-flow or GitHub Flow)
- [ ] **Pull Request Process**: Establish PR template and review requirements
- [ ] **Team Roles**: Clearly define responsibilities (author: Ted Strall, team members, reviewers)
- [ ] **Code Review Guidelines**: Document code review expectations and checklist
- [ ] **Commit History**: Maintain clean, readable git history for project traceability

---

## 4. Data Handling

- [ ] **Data Cleaning Scripts**: Create reproducible scripts for data cleaning and preprocessing
- [ ] **Normalization**: Implement feature normalization/standardization with proper documentation
- [ ] **Data Augmentation**: Develop and document data augmentation strategies if applicable
- [ ] **Data Documentation**: Create data dictionary with feature descriptions and data types
- [ ] **Data Splits**: Define and implement train/validation/test split strategy
- [ ] **Data Validation**: Create scripts to validate data quality and consistency
- [ ] **DVC Setup (Optional)**: Initialize DVC for data versioning if managing large datasets

---

## 5. Model Training

- [ ] **Training Environment**: Set up local/cloud training environment with GPU support if needed
- [ ] **Baseline Model**: Implement and train a baseline model
- [ ] **Hyperparameter Configuration**: Document baseline hyperparameters and rationale
- [ ] **Evaluation Metrics**: Define and calculate relevant metrics (accuracy, F1, RMSE, etc.)
- [ ] **Model Persistence**: Save trained models with version information
- [ ] **Training Reproducibility**: Ensure training is reproducible (seed management, logging)
- [ ] **Performance Baseline**: Document baseline model performance as reference point

---

## 6. Documentation & Reporting

- [ ] **README**: Create comprehensive README with:
  - [ ] Project overview and objectives
  - [ ] Setup and installation instructions
  - [ ] Quick start guide for running training
  - [ ] Dependencies and requirements
  - [ ] Contributing guidelines
  - [ ] License information
- [ ] **Code Docstrings**: Add docstrings to all functions and classes (NumPy/Google style)
- [ ] **Code Style**: Implement ruff configuration for linting
- [ ] **Type Hints**: Add type hints throughout codebase
- [ ] **Type Checking**: Configure mypy for static type checking
- [ ] **Makefile**: Create Makefile with commands for:
  - [ ] `make setup` - install dependencies
  - [ ] `make train` - run training pipeline
  - [ ] `make test` - run tests
  - [ ] `make lint` - run linting checks
  - [ ] `make format` - auto-format code
- [ ] **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Document contribution guidelines and development workflow
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Document all public APIs and interfaces
